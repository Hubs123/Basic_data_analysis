This repository contains our project for learning the fundamentals of data analysis. By working on this project, we gained hands-on experience with key concepts and algorithms used in data science. The analysis was performed on the classic Iris dataset, which includes data on three iris species: Setosa, Virginica, and Versicolor. The project was focused on exploring and understanding the structure of the Iris dataset through practical applications of statistical and machine learning algorithms. 

### Skills and Techniques Learned:
# Linear Regression:
Implemented and visualized simple linear regression to explore relationships between variables.
# Pearson Correlation Coefficient:
Calculated and interpreted Pearson’s correlation to measure the strength and direction of linear relationships between features.
# k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Algorithm:
Applied the kNN algorithm for classification tasks, leveraging distance-based similarity between data points.
# k-Means Clustering:
Used k-means for unsupervised learning to cluster the iris data into groups based on feature similarity.
# Data Normalization and Standardization:
Preprocessed data using normalization and standardization techniques to prepare it for analysis and ensure consistency across features.
